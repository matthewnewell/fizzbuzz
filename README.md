# fizzbuzz

Refactor fizzbuzz to explore concepts I am learning at [Ruby Steps](https://rubysteps.com/) lectures 1-10.

* For the numbers from 1 to 100:
* If the number is a multiple of 3, print fuzz
* If the number is a multiple of 5, print buzz
* If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print fizz buzz
* Otherwise, print the number

Here is a [blog post](http://usefulwebservice.com/blog/2015/01/08/refactor-fizz_buzz.html) on the process.
